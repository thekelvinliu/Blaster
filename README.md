# Blaster.app
a (very annoying) mac app that blasts your friends with messages

## About
Just an applescript wrapped in an app that lets your repeatedly send the same message to your friends (or anyone else for that matter). Only works with iMessage! By default, the maximum number of messages that can be sent at once is **20**. Change it at your own risk.
Note: I am not responsible for any friends you may lose or enemies you may make when using this app. Have fun!

## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/thekelvinliu/Blaster.git
Unzip, and open the app!

## Usage
The display dialogs should guide you through everything pretty easily. First, enter someone's iMessage number or email. Then, the message you want to blast. Finally, enter the number of times you want to blast it.
